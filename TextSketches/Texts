It was perfekt becaus i was young and had the skill people needed websites for good prices

My name is Felix im am 16 jears old and i am still a student based in Swizerland. Since i am a littel kid i have a greate fascination for technic and espacialy for games and 
                    coputers. With 10 i started programming small games with different programming engines. With the time i knew that programming would be my futur job. But
                    since i still was a student and had a lot of time left i decided to get some experience. Since i allready had greate knowleg of game desing i thougt of something
                    else. And so i leart building websites and got familiar with HTML CSS and Javascript. After i got familiar with website building i started making websites for
                    friends and personal contacts. And so i decided to start a small buisiness.
