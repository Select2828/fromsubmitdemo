                        I'm Jamie, I'm a 16-year-old Marketing Specialist. I create video and photo Content for Social Media and websites for different businesses. I'm very driven
                        by creating things and evolving. I've worked in 2 Startups as a Content Specialist, where I acquired a lot of knowledge on how the startup economy works. 
                        I joined this start-up because I believe in the idea of making websites accessible to everyone. I think the idea of students, who still have time and no 
                        spendings to create, evolve, think and innovate is incredible and that this is one of the most important things in life, that's why I'm building this with my friends. (:

                        software engineer. I learnt programming  when i was 11 jears old. I started building small games. But as i realised that programming could be my futur i 
                        wanted to learn more usefull stuff. My brother allready finished school and started working for a company that deals with digitization of other companys.
